# **ENGG4930D Course Project Submission Guideline**

This is an example repository for students who are taking ENGG4930A/B/C/D to submit their course project here.
**Each team** is required to write a `README.md` file for documenting the structure and purpose of files uploaded
to the repository. Your repository should follows the recommended naming convention.

- `coursecode-projectname-documentation` for documents or multimedia submission
- `coursecode-projectname` for coding projects (optional for teams that do not required coding)

A list of files that should consist of:

## Final Report

This report will likely be the key (or even only) document where students can pick up where you have left off. So you need to pass over all related files to us to be uploaded to SIGHT’s GitHub, such as detailed description of your prototype, software codes with comments (if coding was involved), design files (pictures and figures to illustrate your prototypes, 3D modelling files), user manuals, results of user tests, feedback from partners, etc.

Your final report will be submitted here in the outter most directory and the grading scheme is shown as follows:

| Item                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Grade |

### Design Files

This should includes any sketches or drawings of your prototype to demonstrate showcase the design or schematics
for either the software user interface or hardware dimensions and its specifications.

### Documentation for contributors

This section is about the longevity/prospect of the future development of your project, any documentations to welcome and help onboarding future contributors to the project (i.e a Getting Started guide)

### Supporting files

This can be 3D model files, presentation slides, explanatory video (walkthrough guide) or instruction manual for how to use your product/prototype. Any other materials that are relevant to the project in general.

## Example

### MedEasy

MedEasy is a mobile clinic solution designed to help managing electronic health records for doctors and physicians who works at the clinic and does field visit at the slum in Cambodia.

This project started out as the phase 4 of an on-going development of the Easymed initiative.Easymed aims to provide a better user experience and boost the productivity and efficiency at medical related informatics in combination of hardware and software.
